  abstract = {{This book builds theoretical statistics from the first
		  principles of probability theory. Starting from the basics
		  of probability, the authors develop the theory of
		  statistical inference using techniques, definitions, and
		  concepts that are statistical and are natural extensions
		  and consequences of previous concepts. Intended for
		  first-year graduate students, this book can be used for
		  students majoring in statistics who have a solid
		  mathematics background. It can also be used in a way that
		  stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
		  being more concerned with understanding basic statistical
		  concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for
		  a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal
		  optimality investigations.}},

    abstract = "{Background Regression to the mean (RTM) is a statistical phenomenon that can make natural variation in repeated data look like real change. It happens when unusually large or small measurements tend to be followed by measurements that are closer to the mean.Methods We give some examples of the phenomenon, and discuss methods to overcome it at the design and analysis stages of a study.Results The effect of RTM in a sample becomes more noticeable with increasing measurement error and when follow-up measurements are only examined on a sub-sample selected using a baseline value.Conclusions RTM is a ubiquitous phenomenon in repeated data and should always be considered as a possible cause of an observed change. Its effect can be alleviated through better study design and use of suitable statistical methods.}",
